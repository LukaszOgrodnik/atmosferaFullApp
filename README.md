# atmosferaFullApp

The project is my pre-engineer thesis for my Aerospace Engineering Studies. The aim of it is to create application which enables user to calculate athmosphere parameters depended on their height from ISO Standard Athmosphere. 

This project is my first full stack application:
 - Frontend is created in JS react
 - Backend is created in Python Flask
